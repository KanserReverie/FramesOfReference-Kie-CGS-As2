To ensure this file doesn't get massive and I don't put paid assets on a public Github repo I have not included some assets and are ignored in the gitignore.

To get this working download the following from the package manager:
-Octave3D World Builder
-Text Mesh Pro
-Anime X-mas Girl
-SciFi Doors
-Three signs free
-unity-chan! 


Once they are in add them to "External Assets" folder and the game should run again :)
